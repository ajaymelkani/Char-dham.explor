            means sixty lakes. Earlier there were sixty picturesque lakes in
            this region. That is why this area was called 'Shashtikhat'. Today
            this region is more known by the name 'Chhatta'. It is called the
            Lake District of India, because this entire place is surrounded by
            lakes . The word 'Naini' means eyes and 'Tal' means lake. Situated
            between snow-covered mountains, this place is surrounded by lakes.
            The most prominent lake among these is Naini Lake, after which this
            place is named Nainital. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Nainital Length – 1500 meters,
            Width – 510 meters, Depth – 10 to 156 meters
