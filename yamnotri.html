            Yamunotri is a part of Char Dham (along with Gangotri, Kedarnath and
            Badrinath), the four most revered Hindu pilgrimages in the
            Himalayas. The small mountain hamlet, with the Yamunotri Temple at
            its centre, attracts thousands of devotees every year and is the
            commencing point of the Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage (May to October),
            which proceeds from Yamunotri to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath
            and Badrinath. Lodged in a narrow gorge, close to the source of the
            Yamuna, the Yamunotri Temple is dedicated to Yamuna, the second-most
            sacred river after the Ganges. A dip in River Yamuna is said to

            Gangaji Temple of Gangotri is situated at an altitude of 3042 meters
            above sea level. The environment on the right side of Bhagirathi is
            very attractive and enchanting. This place is situated at a distance
            of 100 km from Uttarkashi . Ganga Maiyya's temple was built by
            Gorkha commander Amar Singh Thapa in the beginning of the 18th
            century. The present temple was rebuilt by the royal family of
            Jaipur. Every year between the months of May to October, lakhs of
            devotees and pilgrims come here to see the purifying Ganga Maiyya.
            Like Yamunotri, the purifying temple of Gangotri also opens on the
            holy festival of Akshaya Tritiya and the doors of the temple are
            closed on the day of Diwali .

            The history of Gangotri town and the temple is inseparably linked.
            In ancient times, there was no temple here. In Gangotri, the
            personified form of Mother Ganga, i.e. Ganga Dhara, was worshipped
            by Semwal priests. There was a platform near Bhagirathi rock where
            idols of gods and goddesses were kept for three to four months
            during the pilgrimage season. These idols were brought from villages
            like Mukhaba etc., which were returned to the same villages after
            the pilgrimage season.

            Badrinath or Badrinarayan Temple is a Hindu temple located on the
            banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district of the Indian state
            of Uttarakhand . It is a temple dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu
            and is one of the four most sacred places described in this
            religion, the four Dhams . It is an ancient temple whose
            construction is evidenced to have been in the 7th-9th century. The
            town built around the temple is also called Badrinath after the name
            of the temple . Geographically, this place is located in the Garhwal
            region , at an altitude of 3,133 meters (10,279 ft) above sea level,
            among the high peaks of the Himalayan mountain range . Due to the
            harsh weather conditions of the Himalayan region during the winter
            season, the temple remains open for a limited period of six months
            of the year (from the end of April to the beginning of November). It
            is one of the busiest pilgrimage sites in India; In 2012, around
            10.6 lakh pilgrims were recorded arriving here.

            Kedarnath has been an important pilgrimage for over a thousand
            years. According to Rahul Sankrityayan , it belongs to the 12th-13th
            century. According to a Raja Bhoj Stuti found in Gwalior, it was
            built by him who lived during 1076-99. [ 4 ] According to one
            belief, the present temple was built in the 8th century by Adi
            Shankaracharya, next to the earlier temple built by the Pandavas in
            the Dvapara period. On the large grey colored steps of the temple,
            something is engraved in Pali or Brahmi script, which is difficult
            to decipher clearly.
